# Matrix-Calculator
An assembly program that calculates the basic matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose and determinant).

Details:

A - Matrix Addition

Adding two matrices and producing a new one, the two matrices should have the same dimension (M*N) where M is number of rows and N number of columns so that the user should enter the dimension first then elements of two matrices

B - Matrix Subtraction

Subtracting two matrices and producing a new one, the two matrices should have the same dimension (M*N) where M is number of rows and N number of columns so that the user should enter the dimension first then elements of two matrices 

C - Multiplying a Matrix by a Constant

Multiplying a Matrix by a Constant and producing a new one, user should enter the matrix dimension first, then the constant and elements of the matrix

D - Multiplying Matrices

Multiplying two matrices and producing a new one, the two matrices should have the same inner dimension (M*N) so if Matrix A is of dimension N*M and B is of dimension M*P, then the dimension of their product AB is N*P

E - Transposing a Matrix

The matrix transpose is formed by turning all the rows of a given matrix into columns and vice-versa.
The transpose of matrix A is written AT.

F - Determinant of Matrix

The determinant of a matrix is a special number that can be calculated from a square matrix.
Here, you are required to calculate the 2*2, 3*3 and 4*4 determinant of a square matrix.
